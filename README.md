# Movere

![Movere](Icon.png)

Movere is an implementation of managed dialogs for Avalonia. Currently there are message dialogs, as well as open and save file dialogs, and a print dialog (based on `System.Drawing.Printing`) is WIP.

## Roadmap

- Improve file dialogs (including performance).
- Maybe separate file explorer view into separate project.
- Improve styles for dialogs.
- Add tests.
- Print dialog.
- Eventually move file explorer logic to a separate project and create a file explorer application.
